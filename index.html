          <p>
            Under capitalism, science and engineering have been used to
            concentrate wealth in the hands of a small number of wealthy elites
            instead of serving the interests of the planet or its people.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s time to change this.
          </p>
          <p>
            EngSciMath is a leftist community where individuals can socialize,
            provide and find academic support, and organize against capitalism.
            We are committed to building solidarity with all members of the
            working class, fostering inclusivity for marginalized and minority
            groups, and dedicating our technical skills to serving the the
            people.
          </p>
          <p>
            We strive to think critically about how our science, math, and
            engineering skills are used in the world today and to understand the
            consequences of working under capitalism. We recognize the inherent
            limitations of today’s society, but where possible, we want
            encourage our members to make ethical choices with regard to the
            application of their skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            We aspire to provide a space where members can collaborate to
            develop class consciousness, fight back against alienation and
            oppression, and use their talents to build a better world.
